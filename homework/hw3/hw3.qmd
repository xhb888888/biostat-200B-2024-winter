# Question 1 (From Lab 3)

## 1.1 The intercept from such a regression of residuals on residuals will always be zero (disregarding rounding error). Why? (Hint: what is the sample mean of the residuals from a linear regression model? And what is the formula for the intercept in a simple linear regression model?

**Answer:**

Since the formula for the intercept in a simple linear regression model is $\hat{\beta_0} = \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta_1}\bar{X}$, and the sample mean of the residuals from a linear regression model is $\bar{e} = 0$ given by the property of residuals, so $\bar{Y}=\bar{X}=0$ in regression of residuals on residuals. The previous statemepwdnt is due to the fact that both $Y$ and $X$ are residuals derived from previous regressions. Their sample mean will follow the property of residual. Hence, the intercept will always be zero.

## 1.2 How do we interpret the parameter estimates for the coefficients for regnc, regs, regw? How do we interpret the intercept in this model?

**Answer:**

Here are interpretation for each coefficient:

regnc: The expected risk is 0.46696 lower for hospital in north central region than expected risk for hospital in north east region.

regs: The expected risk is 0.93369 lower for hospital in south region than expected risk for hospital in north east region.

regw: The expected risk is 0.47946 lower for hospital in west region than expected risk for hospital in north east region.

The intercept is the expected risk for hospital in north east region.

## 1.3 What region did we make the reference region by using the above code? Write code to fit a model using a different region as the reference group and run a regression model. Compare the output, especially the parameter estimates. Did R\^2 change? Did the ANOVA table change?

**Answer:** We used north east region as the reference region in above code. I fit the model using north central region as the reference region. The parameter for the two unchanged variables changed and the p value is different as well. The intercept did not change much. The R\^2 and ANOVA table did not change.

Here is the anova table and parameters estimates using central region as a reference region.

Here is the original model with north east as the reference region.

## 1.4 How do we interpret the p-values in the Parameter Estimates table, in terms of testing for differences in means by region? What means are being compared?

**Answer:** Each of these p-values tells whether the mean of the expected risk for hospital in that specific region is significantly different from the mean of the expected risk for hospital in reference region The means being compared are the mean of the expected risk for hospital in the reference region and the mean of the expected risk for hospital in the region of interest.

## 1.5 Write out the null and alternative hypotheses for the test conducted by "test_region". Give the distribution of the test statistic under the null, the value of the test statistic and the p-value. What do you conclude?

**Answer:**

$H_0: \beta_{regnc} = \beta_{regs} = \beta_{regw}=0$

$H_A: \beta_{regnc} , \beta_{regs} , \beta_{regw}$ are not all equal to zero

$F^*\sim F_{3,107}$

$F^*=2.50$

$p = 0.0636$

Conclusion: Since p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no evidence that the expected risk for hospital is associated with region, after controlling for length and census.

## 1.6 Conduct the overall (omnibus) F test for the model risk = length census regnc regs regw. Write out the null and alternative hypotheses. Give the distribution of the test statistic under the null, the value of the test statistic and the p-value. What do you conclude?

**Answer:**

$H_0: \beta_{length}=\beta_{census}=\beta_{regnc} = \beta_{regs} = \beta_{regw}=0$

$H_A: \beta_{length},\beta_{census}, \beta_{regnc} , \beta_{regs} , \beta_{regw}$ are not all equal to zero

$F^*\sim F_{5,107}$

$F^*=11.59$

$p < 0.0001$

Conclusion: Since p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence that at least one of the variable is significant in associating with the expected risk for hospital.

## 1.7 A regression of risk on xray shows a highly significant relationship. Fit the model and conduct model diagnostics (residuals analysis). Report this relationship. Provide an interpretation of the regression coefficients, using appropriate units.

**Answer:**

Simple Linear Regression Model:

$\hat{Y_i}=1.79202+0.03140x_i$

Here is model diagostics:

![](images/WeChat89545b06ea8672c185426980e261f6ba.png){width="300"}

Thee assumptions of residuals are met after examining the residual plots. It shows a linear regression. For the coefficient, the intercept is 1.79202 which means the expected risk is 1.79202 percent when xray is 0. The slope is 0.03140 which means the expected risk increases 0.03140 percent when xray increases 1 percent.

## Investigators hypothesize that xray will be significantly related to risk after controlling for beds, nurses and svcs. What model should you fit to test this hypothesis? Fit the model and report the results.

Given the new assumption, I should fit a multiple linear regression with risk regressed on variables beds, nurses, svcs and xray. The result is here:

![](images/WeChat9262a0ff87d6b587bc4a9bd2e2d11ff3.png){width="295"}

## Do the results support the hypothesis or not?

The result supports the hypothesis that xray is significantly related to risk since the p-value in partial F test for xray is less than 0.0001.

## Provide an interpretation of each of the regression coefficients, using appropriate units. Also report the partial correlation of each predictor with risk.

## Here are interpretations for each regression coefficient:

Intercept: The expected risk is 0.86917 percent when xray, beds, nurses, and svcs are 0.

xray: The expected risk increases 0.02858 percent for one ratio increase in the ratio of number of x-ray performed to number of patients without signs or symptoms of pneumonia, when holding other variables constant.

beds: The expected risk decreases 0.0003393 percent for one number increase in average number of beds in hospital during study period, when holding other variables constant.

nurses: The expected risk increases 0.00223 percent for one unit number in average number of full-time equivalent nurses during study period, when holding other variables constant.

svcs: The expected risk increases 0.01976 percent for one percent increase in percent of 35 potential facilities and services that are provided by the hospital, when holding other variables constant.

The partial correlation of each predictor with risk is:

xray: 0.45260

beds: -0.02311

nurses: 0.11162

svcs: 0.16153

## Conduct a joint test of whether beds and nurses contribute to explaining variation in risk after controlling for svcs and xray.

$H_0: \beta_{beds}=\beta_{nurses}=0$

$H_A: \beta_{beds},\beta_{nurses}$ are not all equal to zero

![](images/22031706918102_.pic.jpg){width="389"}

Conclusion: Since the pvalue is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence that beds and nurses contribute to explaining variation in risk after controlling for svcs and xray.
