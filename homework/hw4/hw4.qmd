# Problem 1

## 1.1 how do we interpret the coefs of the interaction terms? Compare these parameter estimates to those from the separate models.

**Answer:**

nclength: For hospital in north central region, change in expected mean risk associated with one additional length is 0.30337.

slength: For hospital in south region, change in expected mean risk associated with one additional length is 0.43930.

wlength: For hospital in west region, change in expected mean risk associated with one additional length is -0.29237.

Here is the parameter estimates of seperate models:

## 1.2 How would we test whether the slope coef for hospitals in the North Central region is equal to the slope coef for hospitals in the South region? Run this test.

**Answer:**

Here is the hypothesis:

$H_-0: \beta_{nclength} = \beta_{slength}$

$H_A: \beta_{nclength} \neq \beta_{slength}$

Here is the result of partial F test:

Since the p value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no evidence that the slope coef for hospitals in the North Central region is different compared to the slope coef for hospitals in the South region.

## 1.3 How would we test whether the slope coef for hospitals in the West region is equal to the slope coef for hospitals in the North East region? Run this test.

**Answer:**

Here is the hypotShesis:

$H_-0: \beta_{wlength} = \beta_{nelength}$

## 1.4 How do these regression coefficients compare to the previous ones, with length not centered? Interpret each regression coef, including the intercept.
