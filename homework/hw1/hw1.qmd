**Answer:**

$S_x=\sqrt{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$

$S_y=\sqrt{\sum(y_i-\bar{y})^2}$

$r_{xy}\frac{S_y}{S_x}=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum(y_i-\bar{y})^2}}*\frac{\sum(y_i-\bar{y})^2}{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$

$r_{xy}\frac{S_y}{S_x}=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$

$r_{xy}\frac{S_y}{S_x}=\hat{\beta_1}$

**(a) Answer:**

$r_{xy}=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})(Y_i-\bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2}}$

$r_{xy}=\frac{92.41}{\sqrt{2379.93}*\sqrt{49.905}}$

$r_{xy}\approx 0.268$

**(b) Answer:**

$Q(\beta_0,\beta_1)=\sum(Y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1x_i)^2$

$\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta_1}=-2\sum(Y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1x_i)x_i$

$\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta_0}=-2\sum(Y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1x_i)$

Let $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta_1}=0$ and $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta_0}=0$

We derive:

$\hat{\beta_1}=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})(Y_i-\bar{Y})}{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$

$\hat{\beta_0}=\bar{Y}-\hat{\beta_1}\bar{x}$

Hence:

$\hat{\beta_1}=\frac{92.41}{2379.93}\approx 0.0388$

$\hat{\beta_0}=3.07-0.0388*24.7\approx 2.11$

**(c) Answer:**

$\hat{\beta_1}:$ We would expect an increase of 0.0388 scores for satisfaction with healthcare provider for each additional year of age in patient. (Unit:Score/Year)

$\hat{\beta_0}:$ We would expect a satisfaction with healthcare provider score of 2.11 for a 0 year of age in patient. (Unit:Score)

**(d) Answer:**

$\hat{Y_i}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}x_i$

$\hat{Y_i}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}(x_i+\bar{x}-\bar{x})$

$\hat{Y_i}=(\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}\bar{x})+\hat{\beta_1}(x_i-\bar{x})$

$\hat{Y_i}=\hat{\alpha_0}+\hat{\alpha_1}(x_i-\bar{x})$

Then:

$\hat{\alpha_1}=\hat{\beta_1}$

$\hat{\alpha_0}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}\bar{x}$

Hence:

$\hat{\alpha_1}=0.0388$

$\hat{\alpha_0}=2.11+0.0388*24.7\approx 3.07$

**(e) Answer:**

$\hat{\alpha_1}:$ We would expect an increase of 0.0388 scores for satisfaction with healthcare provider for each additional year of age in patient. (Unit: Score/Year)

$\hat{\alpha_0}:$ We would expect a satisfaction with healthcare provider score of 3.07 for a 24.7 year of age in patient.(Unit: Score)

**Answer:**

$Q(\beta_0)=\sum(Y_i-\beta_0)^2$

$\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta_0}=-2\sum(Y_i-\beta_0)$

Let $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta_0}=0$

We derive:

$\hat{\beta_0}=\bar{Y}$

Since Q is a convex function, $\hat{\beta_0}$ is the global minimum of Q.

**(a) Answer:**

$Y=3.724044+0.0025x$

For every one number increase of average number of beds in hospital during study period, we expect 0.0025 increase of average estimated probability of acquiring infection in hospital.

**(b) Answer:**

$Y=2.78402+0.03640x$

For every percent increase of available facilities and services of 35 potential facility and services, we expect 0.03640 increase of average estimated probability of acquiring infection in hospital.

**(c) Answer:**

$Y=311.06760-2.58905x$

For every year increase of average age of patients, we expect 2.58905 number of decrease of average number of full-time equivalent nursses during stay period.

**(d) Answer:**

$Y=138.92708+228.13174x$

On average, we expect 228.13174 more average number of full-time equivalent nurses during study period nurses in medical affiliation than in non-medical affiliation.
